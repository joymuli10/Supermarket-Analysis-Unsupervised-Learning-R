# Supermarket-Analysis-Unsupervised-Learning-R
This repository contains a project that demonstrates concepts of PCA Feature selection, Associative Analysis and Anomaly detection using R. 

# Project Description
The project is an analysis of Carrefour Kenya and it's purpose is to inform the marketing department on the most relevant marketing strategies that will result in the highest no. of sels. The project is divided into four parts i.e Dimensionality Reduction, Feature Selection, Association Rules and Anomaly Detection. 

## Part 1: Dimensionality Reduction
This section of the project entails reducing the dataset to a low dimensional dataset using PCA..

## Part 2: Feature Selection
This section involves performing feature selection through the use of the unsupervised learning methods.

## Part 3: Association Rules
This section involves creating association rules that allows us to identify relationships between variables in the dataset.

## Part 4: Anomaly Detection
This section involves detecting anomalies in the given dataset

# Technologies Used
R, R studio, R colab and various R libraries.
